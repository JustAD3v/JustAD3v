## 👾 About Me

Hey there! I'm a French **Computer Science student @ INSA Lyon** and a proud member of the office of **INSECURITY** association, the cybersecurity association of INSA Lyon. Passionate about cybersecurity, CTFs, and ethical hacking, I love diving into systems to uncover how they work.  

I'm also a huge fan of board games and video games design. So I love coming up with new game ideas and bringing them to life through programming in my spare time.
